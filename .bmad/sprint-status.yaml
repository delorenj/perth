        completion_notes: "Satisfied via external zellij-driver tool (zdrive CLI). Text injection uses direct 'zellij action write' for clean separation. Enhanced beyond requirements with Redis-backed state, intent tracking, and identifier-based session attachment (yiid, plane_ticket_id, bloodbank_correlation_id)."

        completion_notes: "Full notification system implemented: CLI integration (zellij notify --pane-id <ID> --style <style> --message <text>), visual rendering with colored borders and icons, automatic clearing on pane focus. Core functionality complete. Optional: unit tests for routing, integration testing."
